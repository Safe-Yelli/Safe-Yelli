SFS colony on road behind agamshala and next to a park.","A guy followed until I reached college campus","Individual manipulated position of CCTV by entering the compound of the bungalow. Enters the compound wall at a later date. CCTV record exists. Guard was inside the compound.","Female sole resident at the time is taking a bath. An individual climbs up to the bathroom window and peeps. Semen stains found","I was catcalled for cross dressing by 2 men who were eating at a restaurant nearby.","Two men crossed our path twice and followed us (my roomate and I) to royal mart after which they stopped near a tree until we were trying to get out.We were stuck for over an hour trying to find a solution and eventually called for help.They only left after seeing a couple srishti kids crowding in front of the mart. My roomate and I were out for homework and we're just sitting on the street for about ten mins until we noticed them the first time.","My friend and I were walking casually until we noticed a man slow cycling right next to us.He didn't even try hiding the fact that was starin gat us and was talking to another guy on the phone.When I looked back,there was another man on the phone near. Acar,of course could have been coincidence but I was so scared I couldn't stop thinking of the worst case scenario. We were new to the area so I didn't have my pepper spray but my friend did.We also didn't know where the Sandhya mess was.So we were slow walking the entire time looking at this guy who is clearly planning on something.We then notice some PPL who looked like college kids heading towards an area and decided to follow them which eventually led us to the mess.This guy was STILL BEHIND US AND TALKING ON THE PHONE when we were literally standing next to the mess.We informed the mess Bhaiyas and they managed to drive them off.The guy mind you,still tries to come back after this,but the Bhaiyas were aggressive enough to drive him off. It still scares me to think of how badly it could've gotten.","My roomate and I were walking. I see two young men check us out weirdly and decide to ignore it and then hear something (I can't remember the exact dialogue but it was kind of a whistle and something like hey baby) I try to ignore it but my roomate happens to look in their direction and is mortified. We just carried on walking but we still remember it till now.","Me and 3 more friends were coming back from N2 campus after our Aerobics class, when these two guys on bike passed us. At first I ignored. Then when it happened the third time, me and my friend was like ok- we need to be someplace safe. So we stopped where many kids from collage hang out(Ali Bhaiya’s shop).Then those same guys, stopped their bike, they got their white car as well. Now there were 7-8 guys, just standing across us and pointing and look at us. That Is when I put an alert on a college safety group. \r\nWithin seconds, our seniors texted back to stay there. At least 10-15 people from college showed up. One of my friend’s friend called up a local who slapped one of the guys and it escalated fast. One of the seniors clicked the car’s photo and got all the details and sent it to me. The seniors dropped each one of us back to our pg safely. But I'm still pretty shaken up that those guys will catch us off guard someday, because we all saw that they had a big group.","Went to Kanti Sweets to purchase sweets on Ganesh Chaturthi. There was a middle-aged man who looked like a localite. He walked past me in the narrow space between me and a pillar in the shop, where I was standing and inappropriately touched me. He then went to the cashier and he glanced at me to see my reaction. I made the necessary payment and left the shop immediately.","my at the time friend took advantage of me having an anxiety attack, raped me, and held me captive in his room until dawn","I was walking from dairy circle towards Purva Venezia and there were 2 men on a bike outside NCC. I thought they were delivery boys so I didn’t bother and walked past them. They followed me on their bike a little past NCC before Purva, stopped in front of me and then the guy sitting at the back approached me. He smiled and he said hi and was coming closer. I bolted past him and quickly made my way to Purva","Was walking alone at night since I wasn’t worried cause I’m a guy, but a toyota/renault sedan (not sure which) started slowing down while the guy kept eye contact and stopped a few feet in front of me after i stopped walking for a second. Saw the car taking a turn after I turned around and stopped after seeing a cop car cruise slowly on the main road. He turned around and left after","We was unaware of being followed for a few days. I used to take the park as a short cut from the mess back home. Two boys came from behind and acted like they were trying to steal something but ended groping us. We somehow managed to kick ourselves to get away and just ran. We were told scared to do anything about it. We never managed to see their faces. We just informed the umesh pg bhaiyas. I can't bring myself to walk through that park anymore.","A man was seen jerking off near the park.

<div id="why-are-we-doing-this" class="section level1">
<h1>Why are we doing this?</h1>
<p>We live in a scary place in time to have normalised harassment and catcalling. There seem to be too many stories from victims who happen to be predominantly young students. What could be some causal factors for this?  It is very likely that poorly maintained public infrastructure and inept policing strategies are the major causal factors for crime in our area. But there are deeper roots, what social factors cause these?</p>
<p>Situational crime prevention measures focus on the circumstances in which crime takes place, rather than on offenders. Keeping that in mind, strategies should be constructed limiting the opportunities for people to commit crime. </p>
<p><strong>Of the many types of crime that are perpetrated, sexual assault, harassment and catcalling are more pronounced and have impacted a relatively larger demographic of our community.</strong> Fortunately, adopting a proper crime prevention strategy can help curb the intensity and frequency of these crimes. Our objective is to gather enough data to present a credible case and influence effective prevention strategies on the basis of hard numbers.</p>
<p>Individuals with a higher propensity to commit crime might not be pushed over the edge, if we’re able to successfully deny them the ‘opportunity to commit crime.’</p>
<div id="what-is-the-dark-figure-of-crime" class="section level2">
<h2>What is the Dark Figure of crime?</h2>
<p>The Dark Figure of crime is defined as the number of crimes not known or recorded by the police.</p>
<div id="how-do-we-know-this" class="section level3">
<h3>How do we know this?</h3>
<p>There is a significant difference in the number of crimes reported in police statistics and victim surveys. <strong>Victim surveys tend to be a lot more open and don’t require prolonged participation. More often than not, people don’t report less serious offences, like catcalling, to the police because:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>They don’t know that a particular type of behaviour or action is a crime.</p></li>
<li><p>They might be apprehensive of the protracted legal battle that will ensue.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes, a family member might be the perpetrator.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Some studies by academics in India estimate the dark figure to be about 50 times higher than the official crime rates. It is only prudent to infer that the dark figure in the case of sexual assault and harassment is higher. The only way that we can paint a complete picture is to have multiple, credible and independent surveys that deal with the same specific problem(crime).</p>
<p>Essentially, if you want to feel safer and make your immediate living environment feel comfortable and secure, then the least you can do is report.</p>

<div id="defining-harassment-and-other-terms" class="section level1">
<h1>Defining harassment and other terms </h1>
<p>(The law provides a clear enough definition of assault) </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Assault: Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any woman(or man*), intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty (Sec 354 IPC).</p></li>
<li><p>Harassment:  Sexual harassment is unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature which: violates your dignity. makes you feel intimidated, degraded or humiliated. creates a hostile or offensive environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Section 506 IPC - criminal intimidation. (Reverse the gender roles and it still constitutes harassment. Women can also be reported under 506 - Criminal intimidation)<br />
</p>
