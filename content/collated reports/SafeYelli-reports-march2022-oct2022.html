My friend and I were walking to House 40 at 10pm, we were quite alert about a white sports bike following us, but when we almost approached the house, we noticed he had slowed down, and was inches away from groping us. We were able to dodge the attack, and he immediately fled.

I was standing with two three of my friends on the footpath. An obviously drunk man was walking towards us and began to approach us. We started walking away but he continued to follow us and blatantly kept coming closer. At some point, we were half-running and saw him laughing at us being scared. We finally asked the NCC guards if we could stand inside and they let us. But the drunk man continued to hand around and try and approach us. When he was asked to go away he pretended to make calls which we could see while hanging around and the guards let him sit with them for a while which made us even more uncomfortable.

I was riding my cycle at around 1 noon back to my pg, I was coming from the direction of the n5 campus and my pg is close to the taste of india restaurant. So when I turned in that right turn to take that road, I immediately noticed that there were group of me, possibly drunk, possibly, and one of then tried to intercept my way. He stuck his hand out as if he was asking for a ride and kept asking me to stop. He saw me drivert from a longer distance and tried intercept again. I was riding fast so as the distance between us reduced I could quickly take a bigger diversion and avoid any physical contact, or crash. There were other people on the road they did notice what was going on but said nothing about it. After I crossed them I heard one of the other men say that “forget it she’s wearing headphones” in kannada, I heard it because I didn’t have any music on and the cord was not even connected to my phone. I quickly reached my pg and reported on the whatsApp group but it was a scary moment because God forbid it was a narrow road I would been in a much much worse situation, without being able to take that divertion. I feel I narrowing escaped a very ugly incident.

A man on a motorcycle kept going past us on our walk, almost 2-3 times during a 1 hour long walk. Eventually, he slowed down near us and groped by butt and sped away. On instict, I yelled at him and ran behind him but he was too fast and he went out of sight within a matter of seconds.

I kind of remember seeing the person’s face before, we were sitting near freshmart on one of the benches. There was 4 of us. One of the guy with blond hair streaks kept on looking over and smiling at me. I was scared because my friend kept on saying my name. Then when I went into freshmart, I stayed inside because I thought he might go away, but when I came out he was still there and standing advancing towards me. That is when I sped walk in the opposite direction.

A hey guys, a creepy man (possibly drunk) on a cycle followed us for a bit and stopped next to us and tried to whisper something in our ears. He came in very close proximity to us, and circled around our pg for a bit. This was near mahaveer and around the sandhya mess. He was wearing a blue shirt. Just be careful.

We were returning from Kun. Five guys were sitting on a bench in front of the bus stand. They were staring hard when we walked past. Then my friend noticed they were following us. We crossed the road to the other side to just confirm and they crossed as well. But by this time we had almost reached our pg. When we looked back this time, they had vanished. We suspect they had noticed us us keeping an eye
