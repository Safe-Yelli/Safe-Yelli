They followed them","Group of males catcalled individual female outside her own PG","Stalking inside the fresh mart","Walking accompanied by a friend and being stalked at","Accompanied by a female friend at the juice shop and being stared at from the guys in a group","Walking back from Manasi stationery after dropping a friend","Was being stared by a guy while entering into a pg at the gate","Two of the friends were walking back to their pg on a main road and got hooted at by two guys on a bike","3 guys on a bike catcalling girls and boys.","Assaulted and followed by a group of 4-5 male  assaulters. SFS colony on road behind agamshala and next to a park.","A guy followed until I reached college campus","Individual manipulated position of CCTV by entering the compound of the bungalow. Enters the compound wall at a later date. CCTV record exists. Guard was inside the compound.","Female sole resident at the time is taking a bath. An individual climbs up to the bathroom window and peeps. Semen stains found","I was catcalled for cross dressing by 2 men who were eating at a restaurant nearby.","Two men crossed our path twice and followed us (my roomate and I) to royal mart after which they stopped near a tree until we were trying to get out.We were stuck for over an hour trying to find a solution and eventually called for help.They only left after seeing a couple srishti kids crowding in front of the mart. My roomate and I were out for homework and we're just sitting on the street for about ten mins until we noticed them the first time.","My friend and I were walking casually until we noticed a man slow cycling right next to us.He didn't even try hiding the fact that was starin gat us and was talking to another guy on the phone.When I looked back,there was another man on the phone near. Acar,of course could have been coincidence but I was so scared I couldn't stop thinking of the worst case scenario. We were new to the area so I didn't have my pepper spray but my friend did.We also didn't know where the Sandhya mess was.So we were slow walking the entire time looking at this guy who is clearly planning on something.We then notice some PPL who looked like college kids heading towards an area and decided to follow them which eventually led us to the mess.This guy was STILL BEHIND US AND TALKING ON THE PHONE when we were literally standing next to the mess.We informed the mess Bhaiyas and they managed to drive them off.The guy mind you,still tries to come back after this,but the Bhaiyas were aggressive enough to drive him off. It still scares me to think of how badly it could've gotten.","My roomate and I were walking. I see two young men check us out weirdly and decide to ignore it and then hear something (I can't remember the exact dialogue but it was kind of a whistle and something like hey baby) I try to ignore it but my roomate happens to look in their direction and is mortified. We just carried on walking but we still remember it till now.","Me and 3 more friends were coming back from N2 campus after our Aerobics class, when these two guys on bike passed us. At first I ignored. Then when it happened the third time, me and my friend was like ok- we need to be someplace safe. So we stopped where many kids from collage hang out(Ali Bhaiya’s shop).Then those same guys, stopped their bike, they got their white car as well. Now there were 7-8 guys, just standing across us and pointing and look at us. That Is when I put an alert on a college safety group. \r\nWithin seconds, our seniors texted back to stay there. At least 10-15 people from college showed up. One of my friend’s friend called up a local who slapped one of the guys and it escalated fast. One of the seniors clicked the car’s photo and got all the details and sent it to me. The seniors dropped each one of us back to our pg safely. But I'm still pretty shaken up that those guys will catch us off guard someday, because we all saw that they had a big group.","Went to Kanti Sweets to purchase sweets on Ganesh Chaturthi. There was a middle-aged man who looked like a localite. He walked past me in the narrow space between me and a pillar in the shop, where I was standing and inappropriately touched me. He then went to the cashier and he glanced at me to see my reaction. I made the necessary payment and left the shop immediately.","my at the time friend took advantage of me having an anxiety attack, raped me, and held me captive in his room until dawn","I was walking from dairy circle towards Purva Venezia and there were 2 men on a bike outside NCC. I thought they were delivery boys so I didn’t bother and walked past them. They followed me on their bike a little past NCC before Purva, stopped in front of me and then the guy sitting at the back approached me. He smiled and he said hi and was coming closer. I bolted past him and quickly made my way to Purva","Was walking alone at night since I wasn’t worried cause I’m a guy, but a toyota/renault sedan (not sure which) started slowing down while the guy kept eye contact and stopped a few feet in front of me after i stopped walking for a second. Saw the car taking a turn after I turned around and stopped after seeing a cop car cruise slowly on the main road. He turned around and left after","We was unaware of being followed for a few days. I used to take the park as a short cut from the mess back home. Two boys came from behind and acted like they were trying to steal something but ended groping us. We somehow managed to kick ourselves to get away and just ran. We were told scared to do anything about it. We never managed to see their faces. We just informed the umesh pg bhaiyas. I can't bring myself to walk through that park anymore.","A man was seen jerking off near the park. The worst part being that there is a primary school right down the road and the children normally walk through the park at that point in the day. I've seen him on multiple occasions but every time I'm either too scared to approach or he runs away as soon as he sees me.","A guy parked the car in-front of me and stared at me, and smiled like really creepy and just smiled and laughed and parked the car ahead on the road.","It was quite late at night which is why all of us were huddled together, walking our friend back to her pg. When we took the turn into SFS from the Main Road, there was a man that passed by us and said the words \"Ah, I want to fuck you.\" The 4 of us ignored it and continued walking, we didn't see the man again but it definitely scarred me and prevented me from ever feeling safe walking down that road."],{"maxWidth":400,"minWidth":50,"autoPan":true,"keepInView":false,"closeButton":true,"className":""},{"showCoverageOnHover":true,"zoomToBoundsOnClick":true,"spiderfyOnMaxZoom":true,"removeOutsideVisibleBounds":true,"spiderLegPolylineOptions":{"weight":1.5,"color":"#222","opacity":0.5},"freezeAtZoom":false},null,null,{"interactive":false,"permanent":false,"direction":"auto","opacity":1,"offset":[0,0],"textsize":"10px","textOnly":false,"className":"","sticky":true},null]},{"method":"addHeatmap","args":[[[13.100731,77.571101,0.7],[13.106985,77.568991,0.7],[13.102642,77.571849,0.7],[13.104,77.57166,0.7],[13.100731,77.571101,0.7],[13.102642,77.571849,0.7],[13.101194,77.576787,0.7],[13.103925,77.571613,0.7],[13.103964,77.574561,0.7],[13.101191,77.571613,0.7],[13.098743,77.574069,0.7],[13.101223,77.571709,0.7],[13.10204,77.573671,0.7],[13.108275,77.574232,0.7],[13.099506,77.57156,0.7],[13.099506,77.57156,0.7],[13.10667849428,77.575592445936,0.7],[13.100691561904,77.576772760674,0.7],[13.101397207002,77.572576360366,0.7],[13.104103647283,77.571951659857,0.7],[13.103696118229,77.571619749069,0.7],[13.098633,77.5773144,0.7],[13.102290660287,77.57172703743,0.7],[13.098387729428,77.572349309921,0.7],[13.098868415017,77.570874094963,0.7],[13.101171373366,77.57370265497,0.7],[13.101177948041,77.574151849817,0.7],[13.10309004813,77.57322371006,0.7],[13.098754051336,77.570889447226,0.7]],null,"Heat Map",{"minOpacity":0.4,"max":0.9,"radius":20,"blur":20,"cellSize":0.1}]}],"fitBounds":[13.087922,77.554808,13.114213,77.608495,[]],"limits":{"lat":[13.098387729428,13.108275],"lng":[77.568991,77.5773144]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

</ol>
<p>Section 506 IPC - criminal intimidation. (Reverse the gender roles and it still constitutes harassment. Women can also be reported under 506 - Criminal intimidation)<br />
</p>
<p>Even though there is no ‘catcalling’ or ‘eve teasing’ law in India. People often use Sec 294 IPC in cases relating to such offences</p>
