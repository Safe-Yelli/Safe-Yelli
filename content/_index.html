My roomate and I were out for homework and we're just sitting on the street for about ten mins until we noticed them the first time. ","<strong>I do not know what it is, I just felt unsafe<\/strong> <br/> <br/>March 05 2021, Time: 17 00<br/> <br/>My friend and I were walking casually until we noticed a man slow cycling right next to us.He didn't even try hiding the fact that was starin gat us and was talking to another guy on the phone.When I looked back,there was another man on the phone near. Acar,of course could have been coincidence but I was so scared I couldn't stop thinking of the worst case scenario. We were new to the area so I didn't have my pepper spray but my friend did.We also didn't know where the Sandhya mess was.So we were slow walking the entire time looking at this guy who is clearly planning on something.We then notice some PPL who looked like college kids heading towards an area and decided to follow them which eventually led us to the mess.This guy was STILL BEHIND US AND TALKING ON THE PHONE when we were literally standing next to the mess.We informed the mess Bhaiyas and they managed to drive them off.The guy mind you,still tries to come back after this,but the Bhaiyas were aggressive enough to drive him off. It still scares me to think of how badly it could've gotten. ","<strong>I do not know what it is, I just felt unsafe<\/strong> <br/> <br/>May 16 2021, Time: 17 30<br/> <br/>My roomate and I were walking. I see two young men check us out weirdly and decide to ignore it and then hear something (I can't remember the exact dialogue but it was kind of a whistle and something like hey baby) I try to ignore it but my roomate happens to look in their direction and is mortified. We just carried on walking but we still remember it till now. ","<strong>I do not know what it is, I just felt unsafe<\/strong> <br/> <br/>October 07 2021, Time: 18 15<br/> <br/>Me and 3 more friends were coming back from N2 campus after our Aerobics class, when these two guys on bike passed us. At first I ignored. Then when it happened the third time, me and my friend was like ok- we need to be someplace safe. So we stopped where many kids from collage hang out(Ali Bhaiya’s shop).Then those same guys, stopped their bike, they got their white car as well. Now there were 7-8 guys, just standing across us and pointing and look at us. That Is when I put an alert on a college safety group. \nWithin seconds, our seniors texted back to stay there. At least 10-15 people from college showed up. One of my friend’s friend called up a local who slapped one of the guys and it escalated fast. One of the seniors clicked the car’s photo and got all the details and sent it to me. The seniors dropped each one of us back to our pg safely. But I'm still pretty shaken up that those guys will catch us off guard someday, because we all saw that they had a big group. ","<strong>NA<\/strong> <br/> <br/>September 10 2021, Time: 13 00<br/> <br/>Went to Kanti Sweets to purchase sweets on Ganesh Chaturthi. There was a middle-aged man who looked like a localite. He walked past me in the narrow space between me and a pillar in the shop, where I was standing and inappropriately touched me. He then went to the cashier and he glanced at me to see my reaction. I made the necessary payment and left the shop immediately. ","<strong>I do not know what it is, I just felt unsafe<\/strong> <br/> <br/>December 14 2019, Time: 22 30<br/> <br/>my at the time friend took advantage of me having an anxiety attack, raped me, and held me captive in his room until dawn ","<strong>I do not know what it is, I just felt unsafe<\/strong> <br/> <br/>March 22 2021, Time: 16 00<br/> <br/>I was walking from dairy circle towards Purva Venezia and there were 2 men on a bike outside NCC. I thought they were delivery boys so I didn’t bother and walked past them. They followed me on their bike a little past NCC before Purva, stopped in front of me and then the guy sitting at the back approached me. He smiled and he said hi and was coming closer. I bolted past him and quickly made my way to Purva ","<strong>I do not know what it is, I just felt unsafe<\/strong> <br/> <br/>October 02 2021, Time: 21 54<br/> <br/>Was walking alone at night since I wasn’t worried cause I’m a guy, but a toyota/renault sedan (not sure which) started slowing down while the guy kept eye contact and stopped a few feet in front of me after i stopped walking for a second. Saw the car taking a turn after I turned around and stopped after seeing a cop car cruise slowly on the main road. He turned around and left after ","<strong>Assault<\/strong> <br/> <br/>October 04 2018, Time: 10 00<br/> <br/>We was unaware of being followed for a few days. I used to take the park as a short cut from the mess back home. Two boys came from behind and acted like they were trying to steal something but ended groping us. We somehow managed to kick ourselves to get away and just ran. We were told scared to do anything about it. We never managed to see their faces. We just informed the umesh pg bhaiyas. I can't bring myself to walk through that park anymore. ","<strong>NA<\/strong> <br/> <br/>June 24 2018, Time: 16 00<br/> <br/>A man was seen jerking off near the park. The worst part being that there is a primary school right down the road and the children normally walk through the park at that point in the day. I've seen him on multiple occasions but every time I'm either too scared to approach or he runs away as soon as he sees me. ","<strong>I do not know what it is, I just felt unsafe<\/strong> <br/> <br/>October 15 2021, Time: 22 00<br/> <br/>A guy parked the car in-front of me and stared at me, and smiled like really creepy and just smiled and laughed and parked the car ahead on the road. ","<strong>Harassment,Catcalling<\/strong> <br/> <br/>September 30 2021, Time: 01 30<br/> <br/>It was quite late at night which is why all of us were huddled together, walking our friend back to her pg. When we took the turn into SFS from the Main Road, there was a man that passed by us and said the words \"Ah, I want to fuck you.\" The 4 of us ignored it and continued walking, we didn't see the man again but it definitely scarred me and prevented me from ever feeling safe walking down that road. ","<strong>Catcalling<\/strong> <br/> <br/>November 09 2021, Time: 21 00<br/> <br/>my friend and i were walking and a few guys were making weird noises and catcalling us, we ignored them but they didnt stop. we walked faster till we reached our pgs. they were standing in an unlit area so we didn't see how many guys were there but i think there were 2-3 of them ","<strong>Harassment<\/strong> <br/> <br/>November 14 2021, Time: 10 13<br/> <br/>My friend and I had gone to drop another friend because it was late at night. While coming back she was on call and I was slightly distracted and a guy on his scooter went past me after hitting me on my butt. I had a pepper spray and my phone was also in my hand; but I couldn’t do anything. I think it took me a minute to realise what had happened and he had already gone by then ","<strong>I do not know what it is, I just felt unsafe<\/strong> <br/> <br/>December 05 2021, Time: 09 46<br/> <br/>Me and one friend of mine were followed from be cool to Ali bhaiy’s by two men. They stood by us new the juice centre and never even ordered anything. We decided for them to leave and they didn’t. They walked only when we started walking. By this time two more of our friends were in their way to escort us home, these men stood by their car and kept staring and pointing at us as we stood away from them unable to cross them. The minute we met our friends they sat inside the car. ","<strong>Assault,Harassment<\/strong> <br/> <br/>November 15 2021, Time: 22 30<br/> <br/>Was stalked by someone for a while and was groped by them while on a jog.

I immediately ran away towards the other side. There were other people on the street around me, I don't know what happened after or if anyone else saw him. ","<strong>Assault,Harassment<\/strong> <br/> <br/>March 12 2022, Time: 21 00<br/> <br/>I was walking along with three other people around 9:00pm on the 12th of March on the main road of 232 Umesh. A man on a bike slowed down behind us(without us realising) and hit my friends ass and rode off. Keep in mind it was the four of us including a guy. ","<strong>Catcalling<\/strong> <br/> <br/>March 15 2022, Time: 17 50<br/> <br/>3 young boys riding bicycles wearing blue uniform catcalled me while I was coming home from college.

","<strong>I do not know what it is, I just felt unsafe<\/strong> <br/> <br/>December 11 2021, Time: 08 50<br/> <br/>While walking down the long straight road that leads to N3, I was caught off guard by a person standing on a First floor terrace, in an indecent state, engaging in masterbation while looking down at the road, as the girls walked to college. I saw him from the corner of my eye and then made eye contact with him, but he did not stop and I could not take any action at the moment. ","<strong>Catcalling<\/strong> <br/> <br/>October 21 2021, Time: 10 16<br/> <br/>A guy in a white car drove along side me while I was walking towards the mess area and made whisteling sounds while making faces at me.

Or use my weapon ","<strong>Groping<\/strong> <br/> <br/>March 24 2022, Time: 04 40<br/> <br/>A friend and i were walking in a street near the Sandhya Pg mess when a man on a bike (he wore a black jacket, had short black hair, was dark and the bike had a red end), pinched my ass and sped off. Later on, he was seen outside my pg while i was returning home by my friend who dropped me home.

We were able to dodge the attack, and he immediately fled. ","<strong>Stalking<\/strong> <br/> <br/>March 26 2022, Time: 16 45<br/> <br/>Me and two of my friends were followed by a man in a black honda city  DL10CK2303 .

An obviously drunk man was walking towards us and began to approach us. We started walking away but he continued to follow us and blatantly kept coming closer. At some point, we were half-running and saw him laughing at us being scared. We finally asked the NCC guards if we could stand inside and they let us. But the drunk man continued to hand around and try and approach us. When he was asked to go away he pretended to make calls which we could see while hanging around and the guards let him sit with them for a while which made us even more uncomfortable.

&gt; “Because it’s on you to always do the right thing”</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, there are certain steps you can take to stop them. If you don’t report it, they’re just going to keep doing it. You now have the power to do something about it. Every report helps us paint a more comprehensive picture, essentially mapping these crimes in order to influence policing and public policy.

&gt; <strong>“Because If you don’t do anything about it, you become complicit”</strong></p>
<p>As socially responsible human beings, it is our duty to do everything we can to make sure that the world is a safer place today than it was yesterday. Seems far fetched? Well, Let’s start with making our immediate surroundings safe. Let’s strive towards a society where a woman can walk down the street without fear of harassment!

<h1>Defining harassment and other terms</h1>
<p>(The law provides a clear enough definition of assault)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Assault: Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any woman(or man*), intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty (Sec 354 IPC).</p></li>
<li><p>Harassment:  Sexual harassment is unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature which: violates your dignity. makes you feel intimidated, degraded or humiliated. creates a hostile or offensive environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Section 506 IPC - criminal intimidation. (Reverse the gender roles and it still constitutes harassment. Women can also be reported under 506 - Criminal intimidation)<br />
</p>
<p>Even though there is no ‘catcalling’ or ‘eve teasing’ law in India. People often use Sec 294 IPC in cases relating to such offences</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Obscene acts and songs.—Whoever, to the annoyance of others—</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>does any obscene act in any public place, or</p></li>
<li><p>sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place </p></li>
