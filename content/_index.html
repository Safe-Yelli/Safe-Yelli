- title: Why?
  content: "> **\"If you see something, do something\"**\n\nIf you see sexual assault,
    harassment or catcalling happen to someone else or if something happens to you,
    go to the police and file a report. Additionally, take 5 minutes and fill out
    this form so that you can contribute to a larger cause with your story.\n\n> **“Because
    it’s on you to always do the right thing”**\n\nIf you are being harassed, there
    are certain steps you can take to stop them. If you don’t report it, they’re just
    going to keep doing it. You now have the power to do something about it. Every
    report helps us paint a more comprehensive picture, essentially mapping these
    crimes in order to influence policing and public policy.  \n\n> **\"Because If
    you don't do anything about it, you become complicit\"**\n\nAs socially responsible
    human beings, it is our duty to do everything we can to make sure that the world
    is a safer place today than it was yesterday. Seems far fetched? Well, Let's start
    with making our immediate surroundings safe. Let's strive towards a society where
    a woman can walk down the street without fear of harassment! \n"
- title: ' Defining harassment and other terms'
  content: "(The law provides a clear enough definition of assault)\n\n1.  Assault:
    Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any woman(or man\\*), intending to
    outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty (Sec
    creates a hostile or offensive environment.\n\nSection 506 IPC - criminal intimidation.
    (Reverse the gender roles and it still constitutes harassment. Women can also
    be reported under 506 - Criminal intimidation)\\\n\nEven though there is no 'catcalling'
    or 'eve teasing' law in India. People often use Sec 294 IPC in cases relating
    to such offences\n\n3.  Obscene acts and songs.---Whoever, to the annoyance of
    others---\n \n    (a) does any obscene act in any public place, or\n\n    (b)
    sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public
    place\n 354 IPC).\n\n2.  Harassment:  Sexual harassment is unwanted behaviour of a sexual
    nature which: violates your dignity. makes you feel intimidated, degraded or humiliated."
