    title: Lack of infrastructure means lack of accesibility
    content: |
     Women find dark, dingy spaces inaccesible. How do we gather data on what causes the roads to be unwalkable? What streets are unlit, dark and inaccessible? We map! </br>
     We will map
     - Streetlights like we have done in Yelahanka
     - Pavement conditions
     - Trash spots
     - Road conditions

     ### Workshop Activities
     <img class="" style="max-width: 80%" src="./BDW-assets/calender.png" > <br>
     This workshop will introduce participants to mapping on their own and contributing to open data platforms like openstreetmap.in. We will test apps and tools that SafeYelli has been developing on the ground. 
     
     #### Start on 18th and 19th
     **Participants can attend any one start day out of the two.** Both days will be a 4 hour orientation and workshop on mapping different things on the ground. We will head out to the Hebbal Railway station to map.
     #### Map for a week
     Participants will continue mapping near their institutions at their own pace for a week
     #### Survey of what people say after the workshop
     On the 26th, all participants will head out and conduct a survey on what citizens feel about the same space that the participants mapped
