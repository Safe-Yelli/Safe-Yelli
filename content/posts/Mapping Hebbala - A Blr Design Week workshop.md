### How did it go?   

We had over 25 participants which slowly dwindled down to 20 in the mapping session. The first day, thoughts were scattered, but our intent was clear:

### To introduce the idea that we avoid spaces

![Participants drawing out their personal perspectives on streets](blogs/bottu-map-people-draw.jpg)
Sometimes we are not conscious of particular motivations that stop us from visiting a particular space at certain times, how do we underline this?\

We had a 4ft tall map that people used to place some of their favorite places to visit in the city. Icecream shops? Aunt's house?
- What if you had to go there at 6pm? 9pm? 11pm?
- What mode of transport do you use? Who drives?
- Do you go alone? Why might that be?
- What do you see? 
- How do you feel? 

These questions brought up conversations that were crucial to letting people place themselves but something interesting emerged out of this. Most people who participated lived with their families and/or lived in controlled environments and possibly had primarily positive feelings in these spaces late in the evenings

### To encourage the idea that spaces are inaccessible for certain minority demographics, lets just say it, women

As a man and as the core intent as to why we started SafeYelli, there is indeed a ***Gender Information Gap***, which I will write more on in the next blog post. Women quite really see things differently.  

For this, participants drew maps of their homes and neighbourhoods. We then asked them to place shops that their family frequents. Who and where do they buy milk from? Where do they vegetables from? Who are their friends, where do they live?
- Now, you have to go to a shop at 10pm, who goes? Mother? Father? Sibling?
- How do they go?
- Why do they take particular routes?
- Are those routes different from the routes their family members take?

### To encourage the idea that spaces can inhibit activity
If there is fear of use, there is an inhibition of life and the freedom to go about life. This is a feedback look, for if there is no activity, the perception of a lack of security is increased

### On making the empathetic connection
For a man to see and understand before conceding to the status-quo. This one is a bit of a question

## What did we fail to do?

### To encourage the idea that spaces are gendered
- There was too less time for connections of empathy to be made
- 

### To reach the majority of the participating crowd
- We worked in too large a group the first day.
- The second day was much more fruitful
