When I and 2 other members of my class started looking into harassment in our community of Srishti students in Yelahanka, we were baffled. We thought we heard about every incident that happens through our groups on WhatsApp and in real life. We were men, we came from relatively safe neighbourhoods as well. As a result, we'd never first hand heard experiences of assault or harassment in Yelahanka. And then we started asking around. We started with women from our class, went to our peers on the streets and realised that every woman had a first or second hand experience to share. 

As men, we simply were and are not part of such conversations. It was that search to document more such incidents that became Safe Yelli? The site and documentation efforts have been running for nearly ten months today.  

We've found it positively simpler and more intuitive to network through students since we are driven to empathize with each other all of whom stay away from their homes and loved ones. As a result of this realisation, we've decided to encourage report incidents from all over Bengaluru while we try and engage with students of colleges and institutions across the city. 

With the help of you, we will be able to conduct engagement sessions with residents of your own communities, talk to them about how they face incidents and hear their woes. Every scheduled day, we will head out in numbers to talk to residents of a particular area or apartment. Introduce them, inform them of our motives, ensure their anonymity and ask if they would like to report/document an incident with us. 

We would like to leave a permanent mark in the institutions we visit and so we are planning what we call "Bottu boards" or "Bhindi Boards". Victims and friends can leave a mark at whatever place they felt harassed, unsafe or violated.
