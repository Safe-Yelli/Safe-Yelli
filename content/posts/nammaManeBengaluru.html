<p>We’ve found it positively simpler and more intuitive to network through students since we are driven to empathize with each other because a majority of students stay away from their homes and loved ones. As a result of this realization, we’ve decided to encourage the reporting of incidents all over Bengaluru while we try and engage with students of colleges and institutions across the city.</p>
<p>With your help, we will be able to engage with residents of your communities, talk to them about how they face incidents and hear their woes.</p>
<p>Every scheduled day, we will head out to talk to residents of a particular area or apartment. Introduce ourselves, inform them of our motives, assure anonymity and ask if they would like to report/document an incident with us.</p>
<p>We would like to leave a permanent mark in the institutions we visit and so we are planning what we call “Bottu boards” or “Bhindi Boards”. On this board, will be a map of their surrounding area on which victims and friends can leave a mark wherever they have felt harassed, unsafe or violated.</p>
<p>If you and your college club or association is interested in getting us to your space, get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:safeyelli@gmail.com" class="email">safeyelli@gmail.com</a></p>
