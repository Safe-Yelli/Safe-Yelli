# Safe Yelli in Bengaluru?


[Blog](https://blog.safeyelli.in) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SafeYelli/) | [Instagram](https://instagram.com/safeyelli) | [Email](mailto:safeyelli@gmail.com)

Safe Yelli is a website that allows for victims of catcalling, assault and other forms of street-harassment in Bengaluru to directly report an incident. These incidents are then marked on an interactive map that serves as a visual diary of incidents for the residents of Bengaluru. 

 # Current initiatives
 
 - [Community Mapping in Bengaluru](https://safeyelli.in/community-mapping)
   - [Mapping Hebbala Workshop](https://safeyelli.in/mapping-hebbala)

 ## Development

 - [Prototyped] [Street Illumination tracker Android app](https://github.com/Safe-Yelli/illumination-tracker)
 - [Concept development] Sidewalk tagging using ML

 ## Research 
 
 - Security *through* mobility, not just in mobility 
  
 # Efforts
 
 ## How do you involve the community? 
 
 We are beginning to have conversations with our neighbours, colleges in Bengaluru and other residents to understand how harassment is viewed. We have a very student specific lens of seeing this issue. Who are the most affected? How do certain age groups and communities view this? What work is being done by the police and NGOs? 
 
 ## Making this duplicatable
 The technological frameworks used to create Safe Yelli are simple, fully featured services that can be easily adapted. 
 - A static form powered by [Netlify.com](netlify.com) is used to collect and categorise reports. 
 - The data is drawn into a map using the R programming language and then generated into a website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator.
 - Zapier is currently used to link Netlify Forms and Google Sheets
