1.  Listing down the questions that came to your mind in the context of the topic/issue/challenge/problem/etc
2.  Defining the vision statement – multiple iterations and refining it.
3.  Data collection to evidence the event/situation
4.  Data visualization: Present the data in an effective and an creative way!
5.  List **insights** from the previous step. What new did you elicit thru’ data visualization
6.  Explore correlations between variables in the data plan/sheet

# How have we gone about this?
## Data collection 
We networked and interviews people in our circles to gather the primary context of harassment in Yelahanka. 

We began to understand that there are several domains to focus on:
### Harassment in the vicinity of your own PG
- How do you gain security while in your own PG? How would the streets be safer?
### Harassment while in a public street
- What locations in the corridor of the Srishti community's movement are hotspots? What cause them?
# Questions 

## Sensitivity of harassment / Privacy of data

-   Since we are displaying a heat map of incidents with details publicly, are we endangering the community at large?
-   We have contacted the Wellness team for guidance. Have not received a response yet.
    

### Safe vs UnSafe as a metric 

-   What if we could let SMI students rate roads and public spaces as feeling save or unsafe? Would that data be useful for students? 
    

## Sensitivity of sharing 
- Is sharing such data going to blow back? Even if the data is anonymous?
- Display radius of incident

## Reliability 

What if we could interface with their (Wellness team) help with acting as moderators.

## Function to empirically measure correlations between infrastructure and incidents 
How do we find correlations between the infrastructure we might map and the heat maps that we generate? 

# Vision statement

To find spatial correlations between catcalling hot-spots and public-utility 

To find spatial correlations between catcalling hot-spots and public-utility and attempt to affect public policy by running a outreach campaign with this tool 


# Insights
## Corridor of high movement between SFS and Campus area
![[Pasted image 20211001195234.png]]
Corridor of movement between SFS and Campus area has higher density of incidents. We find it to be vulnerable. There are not many residential plots on this road, filled with commercial eateries/ cafes/ grocers which . ==!Need to display time of incident

## Need more data, can't make conclusions
We only have 24 entries at the time of writing this (2021-10-01 | 20:10), so we cannot make conclusions of any kind that can be empirically backed up.


# ToDo
## Going to the browser
https://handsondataviz.org/leaflet-maps-with-google-sheets.html
Consider porting to native js to have it pull data from google sheets directly. Run a shiny app?

## Refining data collection
Name the place rather than just fill location coordinates
## Turning this into a campaign
- Interface with Wellness, get their thoughts and attempt to join hands with Safe space to handle outreach in campuses. Key Words: Social Media outreach, Quick action questionnaires on campuses
###  Data Abstraction
- The public version of this map cannot display specific locations of incidents, can it? Should it? Should it display just a heatmap?
