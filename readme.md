# A draft look into Safe Yelli
Work in progress readme

## A community project to involve the resident community of Yelahanka in mapping harassment. Residents can report on a form on the website and it will be added to the map on the site. Understand the dynamics of crime in Yelahanka, read about our community's pitfalls.

Safe Yelli is a website that allows for victims of catcalling, assault and other forms of harassment to directly report an incident. These incidents are then marked on an interactive map that serves as a visual diary of incidents for the residents of Yelahanka. This is a public map that everybody can see.

The data would also help us derive actionable insights on densities of crime and possible correlations between the amount of activity on the street and the composition of residential/ commercial establishments to name a few.

As a group that began with three men, we had to understand the context a lot better than what we gathered at the surface level from what we hear on groups online and offline. To begin with, we interviewed women in our nearest circles, which in itself began to reveal what was so casually walled off by society. We could feel the desensitisation that we've internalised as a society as we heard narrations of stalking, harassment and catcalling from one victim to another.
 
 
 # Current initiatives
 
 ## Incentivising and getting the police involved
 
 ### How do you involve the community? 
 
 We are beginning to have conversations with our neighbours, colleges in Yelahanka and other residents to understand how harassment is viewed. We have a very student specific lens of seeing this issue. Who are the most affected? How do certain age groups and communities view this? What work is being done by the police and the community organisations? 
 
 ### Why would you report if it is not helping you directly?
 Some questions that come up when we interact with people is the question of 'How does it help if you are only reporting after an incident happens?' Read more [here](https://safeyelli.in/why/) and [here](https://safeyelli.in/why_report/)
 
 ### How do you prevent misuse? 
 Read this Reddit AMA thread to how people of Bengaluru on Reddit received this: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/qfjy7a/hello_bengaluru_we_are_students_who_created_a/) 
 
 Some questions that came up repeatedly in the thread and in person when interacting with representatives of institutions when we talk to them about sharing Safe Yelli on their campuses are that of misuse. What stops a shop owner from false reporting on places near their competitors? 
 
 ## Making this duplicatable
 The technological framworks used to create Safe Yelli are simple, fully featured services that can be easily adapted. A static form powered by [Netlify.com](netlify.com) is used to collect and categorise reports. 
 The data is drawn into a map using the R programming language and then generated into a website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. It is a few lines of easily explainable code that when combined with a simple website generator like Hugo make it a very easily duplicatable template.
 Work is on for a guide and a duplicatable template.
 
 ## Mapping infrastructure in Yelahanka
 
 There is work going on to map infrastructure like street lights, shops, park maintanence conditions and timings on [Open Street Maps](openstreetmap.org/). It is an open-source, crowd sourced mapping tool that allows us to contribute to mapping Yelahanka. This data can then be overlayed and used to view possible correlations between crime density and the status of infrastructure.
