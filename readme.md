1.  Listing down the questions that came to your mind in the context of the topic/issue/challenge/problem/etc
2.  Defining the vision statement – multiple iterations and refining it.
3.  Data collection to evidence the event/situation
4.  Data visualization: Present the data in an effective and an creative way!
5.  List **insights** from the previous step. What new did you elicit thru’ data visualization
6.  Explore correlations between variables in the data plan/sheet

# Questions
## Sensitivity of harassment / Objective parameters
### Safe vs UnSafe as a metric
## Sensitivity of sharing
## Reliability
## Function to empirically measure correlations between infrastructure and incidents


# Vision statement
To find spatial correlations between catcalling hot-spots and public-utility

To find spatial correlations between catcalling hot-spots and public-utility and attempt to affect public policy by running a public campaign with this tool

# Insights
## Corridor of high movement between SFS and Campus area
![[Pasted image 20211001195234.png]]
Corridor of movement between SFS and Campus area has higher density of incidents. We find it to be vulnerable. There are not many residential plots on this road, filled with commercial eateries/ cafes/ grocers which . ==!Need to display time of incident

## Need more data, can't make conclusions
We only have 24 entries at the time of writing this (2021-10-01 | 20:10), so we cannot make conclusions of any kind that can be empirically backed up.


# ToDo
## Going to the browser
https://handsondataviz.org/leaflet-maps-with-google-sheets.html
Consider porting to native js to have it pull data from google sheets directly. Run a shiny app?

## Refining data collection
Name the place rather than just fill location coordinates
